FAIL-FIRST: src/data/schedule.test.ts - observed failing against the implementation it replaces
before it was trusted. The two call sites in repository.ts each carried their own inline copy of
the schedule-window arithmetic; both were re-injected into src/data/schedule.ts - `effective_to
<= onDate` (an exclusive end, which is what an inline `to < today` guard becomes once the row is
closed at `new_start - 1`) and a bare `out.set(...)` with no comparison (last row wins, which is
what a plain overwrite loop does). From 10 cases that produced 2 failures and 8 still-passing:

    not ok 3 - a version ENDING today is still in force -- both ends are inclusive
    not ok 8 - row order does not decide the answer
    # pass 8  # fail 2

Both defects were reverted; 10/10 pass and 32/32 across all spec files. The first failure is the
one worth naming: an exclusive end leaves the CHANGEOVER DAY covered by neither version, so on
the day a schedule changes every member is expected at nothing and nothing errors.

NOT OBSERVED FAILING: supabase/tests/12_offering_schedule.sql - 17 assertions on 0018
(set_offering_schedule exists at all, weekday sorting and de-duplication, the staff refusal,
versioning and the closure date, the same-day correction, the completed-session guard from both
sides plus the day-after boundary its error message promises, empty and out-of-range weekdays,
and that offering_schedules STILL has no direct write policy). It has never been run: no docker,
no psql, no postgres binary on this machine (TD-010's remaining half), so `bash db/harness/
test.sh` cannot start. It will first execute in CI. The same remains true of 10_add_member.sql
and 11_holiday_delete.sql from the parallel sessions.

0018 IS NOT APPLIED. It is committed as a file. The live schema is 0001-0015; set_offering_schedule
is absent from it, confirmed by a read-only PostgREST probe from a parallel session. Applying it
is the repo owner's decision, and CLAUDE.md's rule stands: the live Supabase project is never an
automated target without explicit instruction.

FAIL-FIRST: src/data/holiday.test.ts - observed failing against injected defects before it was
trusted. Two changes to src/data/holiday.ts - `if (!to) return { from, to: '' }` (an empty end
date becoming an OPEN-ENDED range instead of a one-day closure) and `return holiday.branch ===
branch` (dropping the `branch === null` arm, which inverts the widest closure the product has
into the narrowest) - produced, from 12 cases, 3 failures and 9 still-passing:

    not ok 1 - an empty end date is a ONE-DAY closure, not an open-ended one
    not ok 7 - both ends of the range are INCLUSIVE
    not ok 8 - branch null means EVERY branch, never none
    # pass 9  # fail 3

Both defects were reverted and all 12 pass; 22/22 across both spec files.

NOT OBSERVED FAILING: supabase/tests/11_holiday_delete.sql - 18 assertions on 0017 (insert marks,
range edit re-marks, delete restores, completed and cancelled untouched, the BEFORE DELETE
ordering clearing sessions.holiday_id ahead of the foreign key, the audit trail, and that
apply_holiday/remove_holiday are still NOT executable by `authenticated`). It has never been
run: there is no docker, no psql and no postgres server binary on this machine (TD-010's
remaining half), so `bash db/harness/test.sh` cannot start. It will first execute in CI. The
same is true of supabase/tests/10_add_member.sql from the parallel session.

Gate G8 Functional / integration still FAILs on a missing `test:functional` script (TD-006) -
which remains the one step that would have caught RC-008, and would catch a delete button whose
migration is unapplied (TD-013).

FAIL-FIRST: src/data/attendance.test.ts - observed failing against an injected defect before it was trusted.
Removing the `if (d > new Date()) continue` guard and setting `expected: true` unconditionally in
attendanceFixture produced, from 10 cases, 2 real failures and 8 still-passing:

    not ok 2 - no row is dated in the future
      error: '2026-09-11 is in the future'
    not ok 3 - an absent row is always expected - the table's own invariant
      expected: false / actual: true
    # pass 8  # fail 2

The defect was reverted and all 10 pass. G7 Unit + pure specs moves FAIL -> PASS with this file;
`npm run test:unit` is now part of `npm run check`.

Still failing, all pre-existing and none touched by this change: G1/G2/G3 want design/tokens.json,
which this app does not have (its measured palette is src/theme/tokens.ts, verified by
`npm run check:contrast` - 2800/2800 pairs). G8 runs `npm run test:functional`, a script that does
not exist. G6 has no local eslint.
